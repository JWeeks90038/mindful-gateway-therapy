We want to be sure you understand your rights and our obligations under state and federal privacy laws. Regulations include, but are not limited to:

            YOUR RIGHTS AS A CLIENT
            To obtain a copy of your health and claims records (we may charge a reasonable fee for this service) 
            To ask us to correct health and claims records if they are incorrect or incomplete. We will give you a response to this request within sixty days, and we may decline this request.
            To request confidential communications. You can ask us to contact you in a specific way or send mail to a different address. We will consider all reasonable requests and must agree if you tell us that you would be in danger if we do not.
            To ask us to limit what we use or share. You can ask us NOT to share certain health information for treatment, payment, or operations. You have the right and choice to tell us to share information with your family, close friends, or others involved in payment for your care.

We never share your information for marketing or sale purposes unless you give us permission.
            To obtain a list of those with whom we’ve shared information, including the reason for sharing information. This accounting of disclosures of information can be for up to six years prior to the date you ask. The accounting will include all disclosures except for those we have made about your treatment, payment, or healthcare operations, and certain other disclosures, such as those you requested that we make. You are able to receive one such accounting per year, after that, we may charge a reasonable cost-based fee.
            To request not to share information with your insurer if you pay for services out of pocket.
            To obtain a paper copy of this Notice of Privacy Practices.

            HOW WE USE YOUR PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION
            The most common ways we use or share your health information is to treat you (e.g., sharing of information to covered entities that are not part of your direct treatment team), to operate our practice (e.g., to contact you, schedule appointments, etc.), and to bill for our services.  The less common ways we use or share you health information include: when we must report suspected abuse, neglect, or domestic violence, report adverse medication reactions, assist with public health and safety issues, prevent or reduce a serious threat to anyone’s health or safety, to prevent disease, to conduct research, to support government functions, to contribute to the public good, to respond to workers’ compensation claims, to support health oversight agencies’ activities as authorized by law, to comply with state or federal laws, to respond to law enforcement requests, to assist with product recalls, and to respond to lawsuits or legal actions.
            
            HOW WE WILL NOT USE YOUR PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION
            We will not use your PHI for marketing purposes without your written permission.
            We will not share psychotherapy notes in most cases without express written authorization from you.
            We will not sell your health information.
            ‍
            
            Financial Policies
            All payment is due in full at the time of service. Session fees are automatically charged to your payment method on file after each session. If your payment method on file does not go through, you will be notified and must provide alternate means of payment before your next scheduled session. Clients are not allowed to carry balances, and having an unpaid balance may affect your ability to schedule future appointments. If you are the parent/guardian of a minor receiving counseling services, you are responsible for all associated fees.
            
            If you need to cancel or reschedule your appointment, you must do so at least 24 hours in advance of your scheduled appointment. If you miss your appointment or request to cancel/reschedule within 24 hours, you will be subject to a charge for the full cost of the session ($160), not your copay or coinsurance. If you contact your therapist outside of business hours, your request will still be received as long as you provide 24 hours notice.
            
            If you are using insurance to pay for sessions, you are responsible for knowing your coverage and for paying any fees not covered by insurance. Sage Therapy Chicago, PLLC will obtain an estimated verification of benefits for you as a courtesy prior to your appointment and  file claims to your insurance company. It may take a few weeks for claims to process and sometimes coverage may be different from the initial estimate we retrieve. Once your claims are processed our billing department will notify you of unexpected costs. If your insurance company is out of network, it is your responsibility to request a receipt of services from your therapist and/or our billing department.</p>
