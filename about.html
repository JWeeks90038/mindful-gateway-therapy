        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div class="centered-content">
        <p><em>Is therapy right for me?</em><br>



Therapy can be beneficial for anyone. People seek therapy for a variety of reasons, from managing anxiety and depression to navigating life transitions—both expected and unexpected. Others pursue therapy for personal growth, self-exploration, or emotional support. Since therapy is a highly individualized process, it looks different for everyone, adapting to your unique goals and needs.<br><br>



<em>How do I schedule my first appointment?</em><br>



Scheduling your first appointment is simple. You can book a session through our [online scheduling portal], or if you prefer, fill out our [contact form], and we’ll reach out within 24 business hours.<br><br>



<em>Which insurance plans do you accept?</em><br>



We are in-network with BCBS PPO, Aetna, Optum-UBH / United Healthcare, Cigna, and also offer self-pay options. If your insurance provider is out-of-network, you may still be able to use your benefits. You would pay for sessions upfront, and we will provide a monthly Superbill that you can submit to your insurance provider for potential reimbursement. Any reimbursement would be sent directly to you.<br><br>



<em>How does teletherapy work?</em><br>



Teletherapy provides the same level of care as in-person sessions, but from the comfort of your home. Through secure video or phone sessions, we offer all of the same services and specialties as we would in an office setting. Most insurance plans cover teletherapy just as they would in-person sessions.</p><br><br>
